# A-star-pathfinding-in-Processing

This is a simple **A* pathfinding** visualization created for an exam project. Itâ€™s a stripped-down version of the original game project, **Alone Outside**, which you can check out on Itch.io:
**ðŸŽ® https://ab0-22.itch.io/alone-outside**

This demo shows how A* works in a randomly generated maze using **Processing 4** (v4.4.4).

The repository includes:
**sketch.properties**: Contains metadata so Processing can recognize the folder as a valid sketch.
**Main.pde**: Handles the logic to generate the maze (using recursive backtracking). place start and goal cells, run the A* algorithm to find a path, handle mouse and keyboard input.
**Cell.pde**: Defines the Cells class, which represents each grid tile and includes methods for drawing, pathfinding, and neighbor handling.

**Controls**
- Left Mouse Button Clicks:
**First click** â†’ Place start (red) & goal (green) cells randomly in walkable tiles.
**Second click** â†’ Run A* and visualize the path (blue).
**Third click** â†’ Reset start/goal/path but keep the same maze.
  
- Keyboard:
**SPACE** â†’ Regenerate a new random maze.

**Features**
- Random maze generation.
- Visual A* pathfinding between start and goal.
- Interactive controls for exploring different configurations.

**Requirements**
- Processing, available here: https://processing.org/download
